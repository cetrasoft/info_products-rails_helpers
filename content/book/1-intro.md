# Introduction

## Why write this book?

If you're reading this, whether you're a novice, amateur, or professional developer, you're probably the type who takes investing in their continuing education seriously. You're always up-to-date with current methodologies and the latest tricks of your trade. Your thirst for the "perfect solution" or the "best way" is unquenchable. You subscribe to popular development blogs, have taken or are taking courses, and attend meetups. When faced with a challenge you'll travel far and wide to close the gap between a "good enough" solution and an elegant one.

**You're serious about being damn good at what you do and it feels fantastic to be at the top of your game!**

Like you, we're always looking for ways to take our game to the next level, and once upon a time this brought us to reassess our Rails views and front-end code (largely in Bootstrap).

As most Rails projects at the time, the state of things were somewhat of a systematic mess: our Rails helpers had become a dumping ground with no real organization, filled with ugly HTML and CSS classes. Our views were using these helpers, but simply to just hide code away elsewhere without leveraging any techniques to further reusability. Our usage of partials vs. helpers was wrong and inconsistent. 

Sound familiar? If it doesn't, you may want to check again.

This flew by for a while, and even though we could've continued to cop out and blame it on the bad reputation that helpers get, we knew there had to be a better way. Besides, we were tired of stepping on our own toes when it came to making changes on the front-end.

Unfortunately, helpers are not widely covered in the community. In general, good view layer architecture is touched upon very little by standard Rails documentation, with much of the spotlight going to the back-end heavy-lifting (controllers, models, migrations, routes). That's great and all, but can the front-end get a little love? Helpers you'll find documented out there on the internet are simply a mess of functions slung together. 

Once we started seriously working on architecting our half-assed Bootstrap Rails one-method helpers into full-fledged models, we realized what an amazing exercise in Ruby, Rails, and Object Oriented Programming it was. And fun as hell to boot!

## Who we are

So, what makes us qualified to teach a course on any of these fronts?
